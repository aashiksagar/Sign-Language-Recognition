# Conversion of Sign Language to Text and Speech
A real-time computer vision-based application that captures American Sign Language (ASL) gestures through a webcam and translates them into readable text and audible speech output.
This project is designed to bridge the communication gap between deaf/mute individuals and the hearing population, making communication more inclusive and accessible.

## 🚀 Features
Real-time hand gesture recognition using webcam

Hand landmark detection using Mediapipe

CNN-based classification of ASL alphabets (A-Z)

Conversion to text output

Text-to-speech conversion for audio output

Works in various backgrounds and lighting conditions

User-friendly GUI developed with Tkinter

High recognition accuracy (up to 97%-99%)

## 🎯 Objectives
Recognize ASL hand gestures and convert them into English text.

Translate recognized text into speech using a TTS engine.

Create an affordable, efficient, and accessible communication tool.

Support deaf/mute individuals in better interaction with society.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.9

Libraries/Frameworks:

OpenCV (for image processing)

Mediapipe (for hand landmark detection)

TensorFlow & Keras (for CNN model building)

Pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech conversion)

Tkinter (for GUI development)

NumPy (for numerical computations)

Hardware: Webcam (built-in or external)

## 🛠️ How It Works
Capture live hand gestures through the webcam.

Extract landmarks using Mediapipe.

Preprocess and pass images to the CNN model.

Classify gestures into corresponding alphabets.

Display output on GUI.

Convert text to speech using pyttsx3.

## 🧪 Testing
Tested across various lighting and background environments.

Achieved high prediction speed and up to 99% accuracy under clean conditions.

Robust performance without dependency on plain backgrounds.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
Full word and sentence recognition.

Mobile application development (Android/iOS).

Dynamic gesture (motion-based) recognition.

Multi-language text and speech outputs.

Improved deep learning models for higher speed and accuracy.
